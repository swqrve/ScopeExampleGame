# Tower Defense - Scope Engine Example Game

This is an example game created in the ScopeEngine in around 5 hours. It can be used as an example of just a few of the features included in the engine. It doesn't make use of many of the features however,
lighting, particle systems, audio, etc. Those you will need to refer to the engines code, or engines readme for some examples. The code is not an example of how to make a good game whatsoever, and is quite a mess. 
However, it is understandable and can be used to understand how the engine works. Last warning though, don't use the code in an actual game haha.
